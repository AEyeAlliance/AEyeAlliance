AI4SocialGood Final Project: Braille to text converter (Optical Character Recognition/Optical Braille Recognition)

Our model is able to recognize all the letters in the alphabet, capital letters, numbers, commas, periods, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, colons, semicolons, question marks, and exclamation marks (a total of 37 characters). 

Special thanks to our mentors Peng Yu and Francis Gregoire!
